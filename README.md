# Data Cleaning Project with SQL

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a project that involves cleaning and preparing a dataset for analysis using SQL.

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are to:

Identify and address data quality issues within the dataset
Enhance the accuracy and consistency of the data
Transform the data into a format suitable for further analysis and visualization
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [name of dataset]. It contains [description of dataset content].

## Database

The SQL database system used for this project is [name of database system].

## Files

sql_cleaning_script.sql: Contains the SQL code for data cleaning and transformation tasks.
[name of raw data file(s)]: The original, uncleaned dataset(s).
[name of cleaned data file(s)]: The cleaned and transformed dataset(s), ready for analysis.
README.md: This file (provides overview and instructions).
## Key Steps

**Data Exploration:**
Examine the structure and content of the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify potential issues.
Use descriptive statistics, visualizations, and SQL queries to visualize data distributions and detect anomalies.

**Data Cleaning:**
**Handle missing values:** Apply strategies like imputation or removal based on the nature of missing data.
**Correct inconsistencies:** Identify and rectify discrepancies in data formatting, naming conventions, or value ranges.
**Remove duplicates:** Identify and eliminate identical records.
**Handle outliers:** Detect and address extreme values that may distort analysis.


**Data Transformation:**
**Standardize data formats:** Ensure consistency in data types, date formats, and units of measurement.
**Create new features:** Derive additional variables or aggregate data as needed for analysis.
**Normalize or scale data:** Adjust values to a common scale for certain statistical analyses.

## Instructions

Set up the database environment:
Install the necessary database system and configure it appropriately.
Load the raw data into the database:
Use appropriate methods to import the dataset into the database tables.
Run the SQL cleaning script:
Execute the sql_cleaning_script.sql file to perform the cleaning and transformation tasks.
Access the cleaned data:
Query the database to retrieve the cleaned dataset for further analysis or visualization.
